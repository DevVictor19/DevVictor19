## About

Backend software developer, specialized in building scalable and robust applications using languages such as Golang and Node.js.

Throughout my career, I have worked on relevant projects, such as an e-learning platform that supported over 10,000 concurrent users. I also contributed to an AI startup, where I built AI agents for customer support and automation.

My core skills include TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, Golang, Docker, LangChain, LangGraph, RabbitMQ, Kafka, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis. I also have experience developing LLM-powered applications, designing knowledge processing pipelines (RAG), and working with vector databases such as Qdrant.

I am passionate about continuous learning and technical content creation, sharing insights on software development on LinkedIn.
