## About

Software Developer since 2023, working on web development projects using technologies such as NodeJS, NestJS, Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, React Native, and NextJS.

During my experience as a software developer, I had the opportunity to contribute to large-scale products like an online shopping platform with virtual cards and a distance learning platform. I’ve worked on both frontend and backend, although my current focus is to specialize in backend development as a software engineer.

In my free time, I enjoy studying and keeping up-to-date with development-related topics. I also like to create content for the community, mainly on LinkedIn, where I am most active.

If you’re interested in my services, feel free to reach out via email at antoniovictor1604@gmail.com.
