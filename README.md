## About

Software Developer since 2023, working on web development projects using technologies like NodeJS, Java, and ReactJS.

Throughout my experience as a software developer, I have been part of significant products, such as an online shopping platform with virtual cards and a distance learning platform. I have worked on both the frontend and backend, although my current focus is on specializing as a backend software engineer.

In my free time, I enjoy studying and staying updated on topics related to software development. I also like to create content for the community, mainly on LinkedIn, where I am most active.

If you are interested in my services, please contact me via email: antoniovictor1604@gmail.com.
