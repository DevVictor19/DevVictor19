## About

Software developer since 2023, with experience in building high-impact and large-scale web development projects. I have contributed to the development of robust products, including an online shopping platform with virtual card integration and a distance learning platform. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with a growing focus on backend architecture and scalable solutions.

Throughout my career, I have delivered scalable APIs, integrated complex systems, and applied modern development practices such as Clean Architecture and Agile methodologies. I have strong skills in both relational and non-relational databases and advanced proficiency in modern frameworks like NestJS and ExpressJS.

Beyond hands-on development, I am passionate about continuous learning and sharing technical content with the tech community. On LinkedIn, where I am most active, I frequently share insights and knowledge about the software development field.
