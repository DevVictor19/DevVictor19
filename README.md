## About

Software developer since 2023, with experience in building scalable applications and robust architectures, specializing in backend development. Currently, I work on generative AI solutions at Caramelo AI, using Node.js, Go, and LangChain to develop intelligent chatbots and automation systems.

Previously, I worked at Inaesp, where I developed the complete backend for a distance learning platform used by over 40,000 students, in addition to contributing to its frontend. I also helped create an online shopping platform at SmartSE Sistemas.

I have expertise in Node.js, NestJS, ReactJS, NextJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, and AWS, along with experience in Clean Architecture and Agile methodologies. I'm passionate about continuous learning and technical content creation, sharing insights about development on LinkedIn.
